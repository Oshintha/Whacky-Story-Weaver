# Whacky-Story-Weaver
What You’re Gonna Do:
Create a super fun, clicky-click game called “Wacky Tales Weaver”! This isn’t just
any game; it’s where you become the master storyteller, but with a twist—
everything’s told through hilarious pictures. You’ll be piecing together your own
nutty narratives by choosing from a bunch of silly images. Each click unveils a new
part of your tale, making every story uniquely yours.
Stuff You Need:
HTML: It’s like the skeleton of your game. It holds everything up!
CSS: This makes your game look cool and inviting.
JavaScript: The magic that makes your game come to life. It listens to your clicks
and tells the story you’re creating.
Setting Up Your Game Board:
Kick things off with a basic webpage layout. You’ll need two main spots: one for
your storytelling pics and another to show off the epic story you’re creating.
